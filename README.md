## 🧠 Model Architecture: VMMFNet

The architecture of **VMMFNet** is engineered to address the specific challenges of early-stage PWD detection by integrating three specialized components:

### Core Components:

1. **LWANet Backbone (Lightweight Attention Network)**
   * **Dual-Branch Structure**: Efficiently decouples and processes key features from redundant information.
   * **LWABlock & MSAA**: Embeds Multi-Scale Attention Aggregation to enhance weak lesion signals while maintaining a lightweight profile.

2. **HMAFNet Neck (Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention Fusion)**
   * **HLAF Mechanism**: Leverages high-level semantics to guide low-level feature fusion, effectively suppressing complex background noise in forest environments.

3. **Micro-target Prediction Heads**
   * **Stride-4 Detection**: Extends the detection hierarchy to high-resolution shallow features.
   * **Multi-Scale Robustness**: Enables high-precision detection across extreme scale variations, from minute needle discoloration ($4 \times 4$ pixels) to late-stage crown decline.

### Workflow Description:
The study is organized into five systematic phases:
1. **Phase 1: PWN Inoculation & Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of pine trees inoculated with Pine Wood Nematode (PWN) from April to July 2025 to identify sensitive spectral bands and vegetation indices.
2. **Phase 2: Data Acquisition**: UAV flight planning and 3D reconstruction to generate comprehensive visible (RGB) and multispectral (MS) maps.
3. **Phase 3: Dataset Construction**: Manual annotation of infection stages (Early, Mid, Late) and partitioning into training, validation, and test sets (8:1:1 ratio).
4. **Phase 4: Architecture Design**: Implementation of **VMMFNet**, featuring the **LWANet** backbone for feature extraction and **HMAFNet** neck for multi-scale fusion.
5. **Phase 5: Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive testing including comparative experiments with different datasets, fusion strategies, and ablation studies.
